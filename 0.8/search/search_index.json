Ways to Contribute \u00b6 We welcome many different types of contributions including: Tutorials Other documentation Builds, CI New features Bug fixes Web design Communication, social media, blog posts Reviewing pull requests Ask for Help \u00b6 The best ways to reach us with a question is to ask... On the original GitHub issue In the #development channel in the Iter8 Slack workspace During our community meetings Find an Issue \u00b6 Iter8 issues are managed here . Issued labeled good first issue have extra information to help you make your first contribution. Issues labeled help wanted are issues suitable for someone who has already submitted their first pull request and is good to move on to the second one. Sometimes there won\u2019t be any issues with these labels. That\u2019s ok! There is likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you don\u2019t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out to us over the Iter8 Slack workspace for help finding something to work on. Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying that you want to work on it. Something like \"I want to work on this\" is fine. Pull Request Lifecycle \u00b6 Your PR is associated with one (and infrequently, with more than one) GitHub issue . You can start the submission of your PR as soon as this issue has been created. Follow the standard GitHub fork and pull request process when creating and submitting your PR. The associated GitHub issue might need to go through design discussions and may not be ready for development. Your PR might require new tests; these new or existing tests may not yet be running successfully. At this stage, keep your PR as a draft , to signal that it is not yet ready for review. Once design discussions are complete and tests pass, convert the draft PR into a regular PR to signal that it is ready for review. Additionally, post a message in the #development Slack channel of the Iter8 Slack workspace with a link to your PR. This will expedite the review. You can expect an initial review within 1-2 days of submitting a PR, and follow up reviews (if any) to happen over 2-5 days. Use the #development Slack channel of Iter8 Slack workspace to ping/bump when the pull request is ready for further review or if it appears stalled. Iter8 releases happen frequently. Once your PR is merged, you can expect your contribution to show up live in a short amount of time at https://iter8.tools . Sign Your Commits \u00b6 Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to our project's repositories. The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a way to certify that you wrote and have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project. Read GitHub's documentation on signing your commits . You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must match the Git user and email associated with the commit. This is my commit message Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com> Git has a -s command line option to do this automatically: git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message' If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running: git commit --amend -s MkDocs \u00b6 Iter8 documentation uses Mkdocs . The section on linking to pages and images is especially useful for Iter8 documentation authors. Serve Iter8 docs \u00b6 Pre-requisite: Python 3+.

Iter8 provides a set of pre-defined and customizable tasks for the following purposes. Generating load and getting built-in metrics for one or more versions of the app. Getting metrics by querying backends like Prometheus, New Relic, SysDig, or Elastic. Assessing app versions with SLOs and business reward metrics. Triggering events based on experiments insights.
